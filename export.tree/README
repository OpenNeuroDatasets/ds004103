# Collaborations and deceptions in strategic interactions revealed by hyperscanning fMRI

## Aims:

The current study aims to investigate the neural mechanisms of interpersonal collaborations and deceptions, with an Opening Treasure Chest (OTC) game under the fMRI hyperscanning setup. 

## Methods

*fMRI:* In this hyperscanning fMRI study, the participant pairs (n=33) from Taipei and Tainan joined an opening-treasure-chest (OTC) game, where the dyads took alternative turns as senders (to inform) and receivers (to decide) for guessing the right chest. 
The cooperation condition was achieved by, upon successful guessing, splitting the $200NTD trial reward, thereby promoting mutual trust. The competition condition, in contrast, was done by, also upon winning, the latter receivers taking all the $150NTD reward, thereby encouraging strategic interactions.

## General findings and importance:

For fMRI, the GLM contrasts reaffirmed the three documented sub-networks related to social deception: theory-of-mind (ToM), executive control, and reward processing. Another key finding was the negative correlations between the connectivity of right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ, known as the ToM region) and emotion-related regions, including amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and rostral anterior cingulate (rACC), and senders’ lying rates. Furthermore, the Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) over multiple searchlight-unearthed Region-Of-Interests (ROIs) in classifying either the “truth-telling vs. lying in $150” or the “truthful in $200 vs. truthful in $150” conditions achieved 61% and 84.5%, respectively. Lastly, principal component analysis (PCA) could reduce these high dimensional fMRI data in above-mentioned comparisons to the same level of accuracy with less than 200 or less than 10 components, respectively, suggesting that it may be due more to the individual difference in
explaining the suboptimal results. To sum up, these results reveal the neural substrates underpinning the idiosyncratic social deceptions in dyadic interactions.

## Sample Size

Sixty-six (33 pairs) participants, between 20 and 30 years of age (M=23.4, SD=2.9), participated in the study.
